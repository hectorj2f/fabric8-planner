== Overview
Fabric8 Planner is a task planner and the issue tracker front-end for link:https://openshift.io/[openshift.io].
It uses the link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-wit[Fabric8 Work Item Tracker] as the back-end.

The Planner project provides a component library which is used by other applications to provide a task planning front-end.

== Running the Planner

The Planner is available as an npm package. It can not be run by itself as it is an Angular component library.

However, for development and testing purpose, a minimal runtime environment is available in the link:runtime[*_runtime_*] directory. So you can run Planner either as a minimal Standalone component or as an Integrated component using an external webapp like the *_fabric8-ui_*. Typically, you would want to develop in the Standalone mode and test your changes in the Integrated mode.

=== Quickstart

The Planner build can be quickly run using the link:scripts/run-planner.sh[launcher script].

You can use the launcher script to run the Planner either as a Standalone component or as an Integrated component using an external webapp like the fabric8-ui.

- To run a minimal runtime implementation of the Planner using an in-memory mock database use:
+
----
$ scripts/run-planner.sh --standalone
----
You can access the service on *`localhost:8080`*

- To run the Planner in an integrated environment using an external webapp, use:
+
----
$ scripts/run-planner.sh
----
+
Note that the above command can be used out-of-the-box with the *_fabric8-ui_* project.

The paths for the runtimes can be configured using command line arguments.
See the link:scripts/run-planner.sh[launcher script] for further information.

NOTE: To run the script on macOS, install `gnu-getopt`, run `brew install gnu-getopt`, and set it in your PATH:
 `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-getopt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`.

For information on running the build manually see link:docs/building_planner.adoc[Building the Planner Component Library] documentation.

== Other Useful Scripts and Tasks

The Planner uses `gulp` as the build tool and provides frequently used tasks like `npm` tasks as well.
The `scripts` section of the link:package.json [*_package.json_*] file lists all the tasks available.

The following table lists some of the most useful or frequently used scripts and `gulp` tasks you may need to run:

[cols="1,2,4", options="header"]
