== Overview
The *Planner* is an *Angular* app built on top of *Node.js*. It can run as a standalone app, or be used as a library to be integrated into another app, like link:./fabric8-ui[Fabric8 UI].

Development or deployment of *Planner* is fairly platform agnostic, so we can skip the operating system requirements and discuss from the runtime environment onward.

== Development Runtime
Planner uses *`Node.js`* as the platform-runtime, on top of which it builds; and *`npm`* for resolving and distributing packages for the project.

We keep ourselves compatible with the latest stable releases of *`Node.js`* & *`npm`* - however, *`Node.js >= 6.xx`* & *`npm >= 3.xx`* releases are recommended.

== Development Pipeline

Following are the components or parts of the process followed in order to develop, build, test and deploy *Planner*. Most of these components are standard, with limited project specific customizations and configurations applied.

Task Runner::
We use *Gulp* for running predefined tasks. These tasks include, compiling or preprocessing the LESS/TypeScript sources into CSS/JS, building the distributable artifacts, running dev-server in watch mode and general house-keeping (install, reinstall, cleanup etc).

Build System::
We use both *Gulp* and webpack for building the source. While *Gulp* takes care of the library builds, webpack is used for building the (minimal) `*_./runtime_*` to use the library, which makes *Planner* work as a standalone app. The build system works as intended for now, but can be expanded to use more sophisticated switches to build according to different needs (dev, tests, prod etc).

Test Framework::
Our test stack is built with *Karma*, *Protractor* and *Google Chrome*. *Google Chrome* provides the browser engine to run the app over link:https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml[*Xvfb*]. *Protractor* interacts with it as a *WebDriverJS* wrapper and runs the tests according to *Karma's* configurations.

Each `*_filename.ts_*` file is supposed to have unit tests along with them as a `*_filename.spec.ts_*` in the same parent directory. The functional tests reside inside `*_./runtime/tests/_*`. For more details about running the tests, please look into link:./testing.adoc[Testing Documentation].

CI/CD::
The CI/CD pipeline is made with *Jenkins*, as defined in the `*_./Jenkinsfile_*` at the root of the repo. It uses the content of `*_./deploy_*` (more specifically, `*_./deploy/release.groovy_*`) to orchestrate the CI/CD.

Release Framework::
We use semantic-release for versioning and publishing our *Planner* library to npm registry. It's fairly configuration less CLI task (`$ npm run semantic-release`) which takes the latest PR, merges and commit messages into account. It generates the new version number, publishes to npm registry, and then generates the release tag on *GitHub* in one simple process.

Deployment::
At the end of the day *Planner* is a static library, and can be used or served with minimal static frontend runtime as a standalone app or with a full fledged Fabric8 UI. So any deployment stack that can make those setups run, can essentially be the deployment platform for *Planner*.

We use *Docker Compose* to generate the image, *Docker* for running the built app container, and *nginx* as the web server to serve the app contents.

== Application Framework
We use *`Angular 4`* to develop *Planner*. Main application code resides in `*_./src_*`, in which the `*_./src/app_*` contains all the application logic, subdivided into specific functional groups. For the minimalistic runtime added to make *Planner* work standalone, the source lies inside `*_./runtime/src/app_*` which is also an *`Angular 4`* app in itself.

== Programming Languages
For development ease, we do not use HTML, CSS, JS as is, but Angular Templates, Less and TypeScript instead. For UI elements and components, we use link:http://www.patternfly.org/[PatternFly v3].

This requires us to pre-process and build the source-codes into consumable package, but that is automated and this overall accelerates the development process and eases code maintenance.
