== Overview
The following sections describe the tests used in Planner.

== Unit Tests

To run the linter, build validator, and unit tests, use:
----
$ gulp test:unit
----

== Functional Tests

* To run all the functional tests, in the *_runtime_* directory, run:
+
----
$ npm run test:func
----
* To run only the *smoke* functional tests, in the *_runtime_* directory, run:
+
----
npm run test:funcsmoke
----

=== Building for Functional Tests or Standalone Production

1. Build the Planner library. In the *_planner_* root directory run:
+
----
npm run build
----
2. Link the Planner library to runtime. Change directory to *_runtime_* and run:
+
----
npm link ../dist
----
3. Build the runtime using:
+
----
npm run build
----
+
The runtime is now available in the *_runtime/dist_* directory.

== Local tests

To run tests like those done in the CI run the following script in the *_Planner_* directory:

----
$ ./scripts/local_docker.sh
----

This script generates a docker image that you could use to run the planner within a container.

Optionally, you could also run the functional tests by passing `functionalTests` as an argument to the above script:
----
$ ./scripts/local_docker.sh functionalTests
----
